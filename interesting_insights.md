**Description & Key Takeaway:**
*  *Ship time is a calculated field, using order date and ship date. If specific ship modes have longer delivery times: Investigate and optimize logistics for those modes to improve efficiency.
Else if delivery times are consistent across modes: Focus on other factors like cost or customer preference to enhance the shipping experience.*

**Description & Key Takeaway:**
*  *Certain products categories generate high profits: Prioritize these products in marketing and inventory. Products with high sales have low or negative profits: Investigate cost structures or consider revising pricing strategies.*

**Description & Key Takeaway:**
* *Regions with larger nodes (higher discounts) show lower profits (red colors): Reassess discount strategies in these regions to improve profitability. Larger nodes still indicate higher profits (blue colors): Continue leveraging discounts as a driver for sales in these regions.*

**Description & Key Takeaway:**

**Description & Key Takeaway:**
*  *High-profit products are essential for business growth, and you should consider investing more in promoting or expanding the sales of these products. These could also be the products you want to feature in marketing campaigns or priority stock restocking.\
Products with consistently negative profits may need to be reevaluated. Are they worth continuing to sell, or should they be discontinued? If discontinuation isn’t feasible, consider ways to optimize their cost structure or adjust their pricing.*
