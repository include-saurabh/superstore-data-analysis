## Short Insights on Mean, Mode, and Median

1.  **Mean (Average):**
    The sum of all values divided by the total count of values. The mean of the Sales column gives the average sales value per order. If the mean sales value is high, it indicates larger average transactions.

2.  **Median:**
    The middle value when all values are ordered. Half the values are below, and half are above. The median of the Profit column shows the typical profit value unaffected by extreme profits (outliers). The median profit helps compare typical profits to the mean, highlighting the impact of outliers.

3.  **Mode:**
    The most frequently occurring value. The mode of the Ship Mode column identifies the most commonly used shipping method. Knowing the mode can help optimize logistics for the most popular shipping method.
